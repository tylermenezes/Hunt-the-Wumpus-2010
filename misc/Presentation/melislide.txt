Amelia Samson has been interested in technology since she first saw a computer, so being asked to be a part of “Hunt the Wumpus” posed as an amazing opportunity to gain more knowledge about the world of technology and use her love of acting at the same time. Amelia’s been acting since she was 7, but she’s never voice acted before “Hunt the Wumpus”, which is another reason she agreed to join the team. She’s learned so much in the time she’s been working on the project—about voiceover work and how video games come together. The most challenging part for her was acting solely through her voice without the help from facial expression. The least enjoyable part for Amelia did not know much about what was going on with the video game until towards the end. She wouldn’t add or modify anything to the video game.
