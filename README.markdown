Wumpus 2010!
============

This is the project from Hunt the Wumpus 2010. We created this game over the course of a few months,
although most of the development happened in the last few weeks.

How do I play it?
-----------------
Build from source, of course! I'll create downloadable builds later.

System requirements
-------------------
At the time we created this, there were physics bugs meaning it could only be played on computers
with extremely high specs. We mostly resolved that at some point, but it might still run fairly
slowly on laptops etc.
