Wumpus 2010!
============

This is the project from Hunt the Wumpus 2010. We created this game over the course of a few months,
although most of the development happened in the last few weeks.

Checkout the xna-3.1 branch if you're still using XNA 3.1.

How do I play it?
-----------------
XNA 4.0 seems to have broken the collision with the portal in the first level. So while it's possible to
"play the game", you can't actually get past the first level. Someone (me?) will need to look into that
before it's actually possible to play the game. You can still check out all the awesome art and audio
assets, though!

System requirements
-------------------
At the time we created this, there were physics bugs meaning it could only be played on computers
with extremely high specs. We mostly resolved that at some point, but it might still run fairly
slowly on laptops etc.
